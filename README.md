# Ale Frajda! - CodersLab Final Project

The current status of the application
This application is still a work in-progress as I am planning on adding additional functionality (e.g. sorting by the length of the attraction, more information under a map component, comment and rating option for app users etc.). 

The idea
This is a family based application. Parents will be able to quickly sort available attractions in their city by the weather condition (for example, on a rainy day, see only those attractions / playgrounds that are indoor), age of the child (see the attractions/playgrounds matching the age selection and under),and rating. The application should work in a similar manner like polish pyszne.pl or trivago allowing parents to choose what they think will be the best selection of attractions for them and their children. They will be able to plan their entire day ahead of time by creating their favorite list. 

I see a lot of potential for this project. I am also looking forward to continue working on it as I see more and more parents asking questions on finding best attractions for their kids during their leisure time.
